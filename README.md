# MySleepTimer

**MySleepTimer** is a minimalist Android app written in Kotlin that automatically locks your screen based on a timer. Its primary purpose is to lock the screen when you fall asleep, allowing you to stop music or videos playing on your device by simply locking the screen. The app features a dark user interface designed to be easy on the eyes during nighttime use. With just two buttons, simplicity and ease of use are at the core of this application.

## Features

- **Automatic Screen Locking**: MySleepTimer allows you to set a timer, and once the timer elapses, it will automatically lock your device's screen.

- **Minimalistic Design**: The app features a clean and dark user interface to minimize visual stress during nighttime usage. Its straightforward design ensures a hassle-free experience.

- **Two Button Interface**: With only two buttons – one to start the timer and the other to cancel it – MySleepTimer keeps things simple and user-friendly.

- **Efficient Scheduling**: The app leverages Kotlin and WorkManager to efficiently schedule screen locking tasks, ensuring reliable performance and minimal battery consumption.
